A minimal Cloudflare Worker that provides user-to-server GitHub tokens via device flow for `ai-aligned-gh`. 

**Key Feature**: Actions appear as the user (with app badge), not as "app/as-a-bot".

## üéØ Problem Solved

- ‚ùå **Without this worker**: PRs show `app/as-a-bot` as author
- ‚úÖ **With this worker**: PRs show `username` + app badge as author

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub App with Device Flow enabled**:
   - Go to your GitHub App settings
   - Check ‚úÖ "Enable Device Flow"
   - Note the Client ID

2. **Cloudflare Workers account**

### Deploy

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/trieloff/as-a-bot
cd as-a-bot
npm install

# Configure
wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID  # Enter your GitHub App Client ID

# Deploy
wrangler deploy
```

## üîå API Endpoints

Only two endpoints needed for device flow:

### Start Device Flow
```bash
POST /user-token/start
Body: {"scopes": "repo"}

Response:
{
  "device_code": "...",
  "user_code": "ABCD-1234",
  "verification_uri": "https://github.com/login/device",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "interval": 5
}
```

### Poll for Token
```bash
POST /user-token/poll
Body: {"device_code": "..."}

Response:
{
  "access_token": "ghu_...",  # User-to-server token
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_at": "...",
  "scope": "repo"
}
```

## üîß Integration with ai-aligned-gh

`ai-aligned-gh` will automatically use this worker to get properly attributed tokens:

```bash
# Configure ai-aligned-gh with your worker URL
export AS_A_BOT_WORKER_URL="https://your-worker.workers.dev"

# Use ai-aligned-gh normally - it handles the device flow
ai-aligned-gh pr create --title "My PR" --body "Properly attributed!"
```

## üìù Manual Testing

```bash
# Start device flow
RESPONSE=$(curl -sS -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/user-token/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scopes": "repo"}')

# Extract values
USER_CODE=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r .user_code)
DEVICE_CODE=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r .device_code)

# Show instructions
echo "1. Go to: https://github.com/login/device"
echo "2. Enter code: $USER_CODE"
echo "3. Then run: curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/user-token/poll -d '{\"device_code\":\"$DEVICE_CODE\"}'"
```

## üîç Verify Attribution

Create a test issue to verify proper attribution:

```bash
# Get token from device flow
TOKEN="ghu_..."  # Your user-to-server token

# Create issue
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test", "body": "Should show me as author with app badge"}'
```

**Expected**: Issue shows your username + app badge, NOT "app/as-a-bot"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub App Client ID | Yes |
| `GITHUB_API` | GitHub API URL (default: https://api.github.com) | No |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
ai-aligned-gh
     ‚Üì
[Device Flow Start] ‚Üí User authorizes on GitHub
     ‚Üì
[Device Flow Poll] ‚Üí Receives user-to-server token
     ‚Üì
GitHub API calls show proper user attribution
```
