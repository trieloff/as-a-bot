# Security Update: GitHub App Token Broker

## Summary

The token broker has been updated with proper authentication and authorization to prevent privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

## Key Security Improvements

### 1. **GitHub User Authentication Required**
- Users must authenticate with a valid GitHub personal access token or OAuth token
- Tokens are sent via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Invalid or missing tokens are rejected with HTTP 401

### 2. **Repository Access Verification**
- The broker verifies the authenticated user has access to the requested repository
- Users cannot request tokens for repositories they don't have access to
- Access denied returns HTTP 403 with details

### 3. **Permission Validation (Anti-Privilege Escalation)**
- The broker checks that the user's permissions match or exceed the app's requested permissions
- Prevents users from using the app to gain higher privileges than they already have
- For example: if the app requests write access but user only has read access, the request is denied

### 4. **Audit Logging**
- All token requests are logged with:
  - Authenticated user's GitHub username
  - Repository being accessed
  - User's permission level
  - Timestamp

## Authentication Methods

### Recommended: GitHub Token Authentication
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"owner": "org", "repo": "repo"}'
```

### Deprecated: HMAC Authentication
The old HMAC authentication method still works for backward compatibility but is deprecated and logs warnings. It should not be used for new integrations.

## Security Model

```
Before (Insecure):
Client → [knows secret] → Worker → GitHub → Token for ANY repo

After (Secure):
Client → [GitHub token] → Worker → [verify access] → GitHub → Token for ALLOWED repo
```

## Testing Security

Run the security test script to verify the authentication is working:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
./test-secure-auth.sh
```

## Deployment Status

✅ Worker has been deployed to: https://as-bot-worker.minivelos.workers.dev

## Verification Results

- ✅ Unauthenticated requests are blocked (401)
- ✅ Invalid GitHub tokens are rejected (401)
- ✅ Access to unauthorized repos is denied (403)
- ✅ Health check endpoint remains public
- ✅ HMAC auth works but shows deprecation warning in logs

## Next Steps

1. Update all clients to use GitHub token authentication
2. Monitor logs for any HMAC authentication usage
3. Plan deprecation timeline for HMAC authentication
4. Consider adding rate limiting per user
